--- Day1: Trebuchet?! ---
SOmething is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have genv you a map; on it, they've used tars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.

You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.
Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made availabe on each day in teh Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked whne you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just the sky ("of course, where do you think snowf comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loding you into a trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").

As they're making the final adjustmetns, they disvoery that theri calibration docuemtn (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very youn Elf who was apparently just excited tos how off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the documents.

The newly-improve calibration document consistes of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibraion value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For exampel:
1bac2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.

Consider your endtire calibration document. What is the sum of all the calibration values?

--- Part Two ---
You calculation isn't quite reight. I tlooks like some ofthe digits are acutall spelled out with letters: one, two , three, four, five, size, seve, eight, and nine also out as valid "digits".

Exquipped with this new information, you need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:

two1nine
eighttwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
5nineeightseven2
zoneight234
pqrstsizteen

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76 to produce 281.
